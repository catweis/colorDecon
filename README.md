# Color Deconvolution of Histopathological Images
This project implements the algorithm to deconvolve the color information of a histopathological RGB image by calculating the contribution of each of the applied stains (e.g. Hematoxylin, Eosin, DAB) given. The algorithm is based on the publications by Ruifrok, A. C., & Johnston, D. A. (2001). Quantification of histochemical staining by color deconvolution. Analytical and Quantitative Cytology and Histology (Vol. 23) and Hidalgo-Gavira, N., Mateos, J., Vega, M., Molina, R., & Katsaggelos, A.
K. (2018). Fully automated blind color deconvolution of
histopathological images. Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Including
Subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in
Bioinformatics), 11071 LNCS, 183â€“191.
